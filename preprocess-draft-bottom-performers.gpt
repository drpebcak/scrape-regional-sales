Find the key contact person from 'key-contacts.csv' that match the locations in 'bottom-performers.txt'. Tell me their names and email addresses.

Loop over each key contact person we have identified one at a time and draft an email to them.
The email should be personalized with their name and include a summary of the promotions that can be found in the file called 'summary.txt', as well as performance metrics from bottom-performers-by-product.csv that pertain to their location.
Do not forget to include the recipients email address and subject. The email should be in this format:
```
To: {email}
Subject: Performance Metrics and Promotions

Hello {name},

Here are the promotions for this week:
{summary}

Here are the performance metrics for March:
{performance}

Let's set up a meeting in the next two weeks to go over these in more detail.
```

Write each email to a file called '{name}-email.txt'.
